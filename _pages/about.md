I am the Principal Investigator of the Machine Learning for Medical Language Lab (MLML) in the Computational Health Informatics Program (CHIP) located in Boston Children's Hospital. I work in natural language processing (NLP) of clinical text, extracting information from medical records to facilitate clinical research and make the healthcare system more efficient.

I am trained as a computer scientist, with a BS from Marquette Unversity and MS and PhD from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities focusing on general domain natural language processing. My current research focuses on deep neural network methods for clinical natural language processing. I have funded projects focusing on the important problems of domain adaptation for clinical NLP, and learning patient representations from electronic health records.

Jobs: We are currently hiring for newly funded projects!
